I was interviewed by <a href="https://twitter.com/abigailedge">Abigail Edge</a> in her
recent journalism.co.uk piece about how to prepare for a hackathon. 

She asked me to speak about <a href="https://github.com/radiocontrolled/build-the-news">Save my Spot</a>, 
a prototype of an HTML5 placeholding tool for longform articles. 

I built Save my Spot This at _The Times_ and _The Sunday Times_ <a href="http://buildthenews.wordpress.com/">Build The News</a> 
hack weekend in October 2014. It won a 'Special Commendation'.

The interview is up <a href="https://www.journalism.co.uk/news/advice-for-journalists-taking-part-in-hackathons/s2/a563060/">here</a>.
