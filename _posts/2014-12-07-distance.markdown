I've been thinking about how to visualise distance and I thought the <a href="http://radiocontrolled.github.io/long-distance-relationship/index.html">planets of the Solar System</a> would be compelling to explore.

Using Wikipedia, I found the average distance of planets to the Sun, as well as each planet's equatorial radius. I represented that information in a JSON. 

A D3 scale is at the heart of the visualisation. In <code>vis.js</code>, the height and width of the SVG (the canvas for the drawing) is set relative to the size of the user's device. That same height is taken into account in a linear scale: 
D3 takes the minimum and maximum distance to the Sun (with the Sun represented as 0) as the input domain, and maps it to an output range, which is 90% of the height of the SVG.

<pre><code>
	var distanceFromSunScale = d3.scale.linear()
		//input domain = min & max distances
		.domain([d3.min(distances),d3.max(distances)])
		// output range = 90% of height of SVG
		.range([0, height*0.90]); 
</code></pre>

I chose to represent distance vertically, with the Sun as the top border of the SVG and a labelled y axis (using the same scale) running from the top to the bottom
of the SVG. 

My thinking in choosing a vertical orientation was that this would be a more mobile-first approach because eight planets worth of data would be a 
little tricky to display in a readible way on a mobile with a portrait orientation. 

I also thought that making the user scroll (normally I would want to avoid this) could also, in a sense, help convey distance.

A final note, the size of the planets themselves are not to scale (relative to how the chart illustrates distance). However, they are to scale relative to each other's size. 

A demo of this visualisation is here: <a href="http://radiocontrolled.github.io/long-distance-relationship/index.html">http://radiocontrolled.github.io/long-distance-relationship/index.html</a>.
